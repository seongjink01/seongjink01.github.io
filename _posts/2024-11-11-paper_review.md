# Recent advances in OLED design

## Basic Concepts of OLED
-  OLED : optical cavity with emitter inside 
    - various modes : WG, SPP, air mode etc.
    - layers : ETL, HTL, EML (outcoupling efficiency, refractive index)
## In-plane wavevector
- definition : how fast the wave travels in a 2D plane
