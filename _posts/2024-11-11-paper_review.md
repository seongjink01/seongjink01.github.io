# Recent advances in OLED design

## Basic Concepts of OLED
-  OLED : optical cavity with emitter inside 
    - various modes : WG, SPP, air mode etc.
    - layers : ETL, HTL, EML (outcoupling efficiency, refractive index)

## In-plane wavevector
- definition : component of wavevector that lies parallel to the plane of interface
    - characteristics : stays constant when traveling through layers due to conservation of momentum
    - formula : $v=c/n=f*(lambda)/n$, $E=hf$
        - energy (constant) -> change of n -> leads to change in (lambda)
